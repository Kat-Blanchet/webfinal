    Join Trae! Scotland! for a two-week tour of the Hebrides. The
trip takes you to four of the beautiful Hebridean islands,

including Fingal's Cave, featured in Medelssohn's The Hebrides
Overture.

The tour starts with a train tour of the Highlands from
Glasgow to Fort William. After an overnight stay in Fort
William, we leave by train and ferry to the Isle of Skye. While
there, you'll have a chance to tour Dunvegan Castle and visit the Black Cullins in southern

Skye. A boat trip to Mallaig follows and tour through Moidart where we'll visit the most
western point in Great Britain.

No tour of the Hebrides can be complete whth a visit to Iona and Fingal's Cave. Plenty of
time will be available for touring the abbey at Iona and touring the ruins. Pay your respects at

the grave of St. Columba who, as the legends tell it, was a disciple of St. Patrick and brought
Christianity to the Highlands.

You'll spend the next three days in Oban and on the Isle of Jura. Be sure to take some time
to sample its world-famous scotch! The trip concludes with two days in Glasgow.
